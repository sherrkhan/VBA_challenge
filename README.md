# VBA_challenge
Assignment 2 

## Overview

This Excersice is to explore the power of VBA and how it can assisst in reoccurring work. We can express this in coding and perform tedious tasks such as the current stock analysis again and again with multiple parameters. This assignment is to measure all the data from 2017-2018 seperately to see the inventments is feasable or not in the
tickers seleceted. 

## Results

Individually analysing both years will allow us to see which stocks are feasible to invest in and showing healthy trends and avoid costly mistakes. 

### 2017 Stock analysis

According to the results 2017 can be seen in green and are giving nice early returns. All selected tickers (STOCKS) are doing well except TERP. 
In order to invest this data can be further analysised as the condition of the overall market and the sectors that these stocks lies in. 
but through this excercise a clear indication can be driven that the yearly performance of this portfolio is very good

### 2018 Stock analysis

From this dataset the stocks took a hit in the 2018 year. Most of the stocks are underperforming except ENPH and RUN. 
THey have carried their good performence from 2017 into 2018. Again looking at few other external factors the data should be analysed inorder to make 
sound decisions. But From this given protfolio these two stocks have stood as clear winners

### Summary

Refactoring the code can involve indepth analysis of overall performace of the code itself. From cleanup to using commands that are to be replaced in order to run the code swiftly. use of whitespace, defining variables data types, and other cleanup methods define the run time of the code and quicken the results. The overall appearence also plays the part, if the code has multiple formatting (which is not adding value to the output) it can be tonned down to improve speed of the code

This example does not have major improvements as the programme is not huge, but for larger codes this can significantly add value.
